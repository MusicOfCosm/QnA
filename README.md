# Q&A

Python is the first programming language that I learned by myself.

This project was inspired by the Q&As that some teachers in some subjects put in their subject's section in the university's site (unfortunately, not everyone did this, it was the best way to learn). 

For this repository I separated the earlier project that runs on the terminal, and the latter that uses Tkinter.

Of course, I made sure to edit the code so that it could work (especially in regards to file paths), and changed some things for the sake of privacy. But I'll still show some terrible practice that I did: this was the time I learned how importing other Python files worked, and following tutorials, I was told to use `if __name__ == '__main__':`, though I didn't understand the purpose of it, same with logging (I was a beginner, but be prepared still).

If I want to remake this project in the future, I'd probably learn JavaScript to make it accessible, or try to make a phone app.


## Terminal

My first iteration took place only in the terminal. It was good, but after adding images and learning the existence of Tkinter, I wanted to make a GUI instead, so I left it.


## GUI

I spent months making the GUI version of this project, somtimes coming back to it to add new features that supports different kinds of questions. But I made code that is so messy, you'll probably want to vomit.


## QCM_to_pdf.py

I made this to be able to share Q&As in a pdf format. Unfortunately, I since added features to `QCM_GUI.py`, so it doesn't work on recent Q&As. I have included a pdf where you can see the result of one, though I removed the python file and the generated tex file that it comes from since it has links to a bunch of images.
